Place the provided Windchill logo image in this directory as `windchill-logo.png`.

Recommended sizes:
- Height: 32px for header use (keeps it visually similar to the original emoji size)
- Provide a higher-resolution (2x) version for retina screens if available, e.g. `windchill-logo@2x.png`.

To use a favicon, place your favicon image in this directory as `mcp.png` (PNG is recommended).
- Typical favicon sizes: 16x16, 32x32. A 32x32 PNG works well for most browsers.
- For best results provide multiple sizes or an .ico file; update `angular-ui/src/index.html` if you use a different filename.

Referencing path in templates: `assets/windchill-logo.png` and `assets/mcp.png` for the favicon.

If you prefer the files under different names or paths, update the corresponding HTML files accordingly.
