# Windchill Parts Analysis Summary

**Analysis Date:** 2025-09-29
**Windchill System:** http://plm.windchill.com/Windchill
**Analysis Tool:** windchill-mcp-server parts analyzer

## Executive Summary

The analysis queried all parts in the Windchill system and examined their BOM structures to categorize them into assemblies, end items, and components.

## Key Findings

### Total Part Count
- **Total Parts in System:** 25 parts

### Part Categories

#### 1. Assemblies (Parts with Children)
- **Count:** 0
- **Percentage:** 0.0%
- **Definition:** Parts that contain child components in their BOM structure

No assemblies were found in the system. This indicates that either:
- BOM structures have not been created yet for these parts
- The parts are all leaf-level components
- BOM data may need to be loaded or configured differently

#### 2. End Items (Top-Level Products)
- **Count:** 0
- **Percentage:** 0.0%
- **Definition:** Assemblies that are not used as components in any other assembly (finished products)

No end items were identified because no assemblies exist in the system.

#### 3. Components (Parts without Children)
- **Count:** 25
- **Percentage:** 100.0%
- **Definition:** Individual parts that do not have child components

All parts in the system are currently classified as components.

## Observations

1. **Part Naming Conventions:** Two distinct naming patterns are observed:
   - GC-series: GC000018 through GC000034 (likely luggage cart components)
   - WCDS-series: WCDS000xxx (appears to be crankshaft and related parts)

2. **Lifecycle State:** All parts are in "INWORK" state, indicating they are still under development or design.

3. **Potential Assemblies:** Several part names suggest they should be assemblies:
   - GC000031: WHEELS_ASSEM (name indicates assembly)
   - WCDS000204: 01-2_crankshaft.asm (file extension .asm suggests assembly)
   - WCDS000561: 01-51243.asm (file extension .asm suggests assembly)

4. **BOM Structure Status:** The absence of BOM relationships suggests that:
   - BOM structures may need to be created
   - Data may need to be migrated or imported
   - Assembly structures exist in CAD but haven't been published to Windchill

## Recommendations

1. **BOM Creation:** Create BOM structures for parts that are assemblies, especially:
   - WHEELS_ASSEM (GC000031)
   - Parts with .asm file extensions

2. **Data Validation:** Verify that BOM structures are correctly published from CAD systems to Windchill

3. **Structure Review:** Review the part structure to ensure assemblies have proper parent-child relationships

4. **Lifecycle Management:** Consider advancing parts from "In Work" state to more mature lifecycle states as appropriate

## Technical Details

### Analysis Methodology

The analysis script:
1. Retrieved all parts from Windchill using OData REST API
2. For each part, queried the BOM structure endpoint to check for child components
3. For each part, queried the usage endpoint to check if used in other assemblies
4. Categorized parts based on:
   - Has children = Assembly
   - Assembly not used elsewhere = End Item
   - No children = Component

### API Endpoints Used
- Parts: `/servlet/odata/ProdMgmt/Parts`
- BOM Structure: `/servlet/odata/ProdMgmt/Parts('ID')/Structure`
- Usage: `/servlet/odata/ProdMgmt/Parts('ID')/UsedIn`

### Script Location
Analysis script: `/Users/carstenlawrenz/GIT/KTB3/windchill-mcp-server/src/scripts/analyze-parts.ts`

## Conclusion

The Windchill system currently contains 25 parts, all of which are categorized as components without BOM structures. To enable full PLM capabilities including assembly management, change impact analysis, and BOM reporting, BOM structures should be created for the appropriate parts, particularly those identified as potential assemblies.
